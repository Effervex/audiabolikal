First third
 * The drop box on the top-left corner sorts which types of items. Beside it is a box filtering results with vale mods less than or equal to a value.
 * The list of all items. Items can be selected and their details will be shown in the other two parts of the screen.
 * The Total labels list the total ATK, DEF, HIT and EVA of the items in the list. Also shows their combined variances.
 * Uncovered Genres shows a list of genres not covered by the list of items. Ideally, for each type of item, they should cover all genres.

Second third
 * The base name of the item.
 * The attributes and variances. Total Attributes details the unallocated points for the attributes, where each item should use an average of X points.
 * Value mod is the value modifier. Essentially, value mod is the rarity of the item. Average value simply applies the value mod to the current attributes.
 * Genres lists the genres associated with the item and their weights (0.1-1). More genres can be added from a set list of genres by clicking 'Add genres.'
 * Colours lists the colours associated with the item and their weights(0.1-1). More colours can be added from a palette by clicking 'Add colours.'
 * Mesh and texture define the file where the mest and texture are stored.

Third third
 * The 3d textured and coloured model of the item.
 * If manually adjust is unselected, the model spins about the Y-axis at a constant speed. Else the user can adjust the model position.
 * If choose colour is unselected, the model cycles through the colours of the item. Else the user can select the colour.
 * Zoom adjusts the level of zoom on the item.

The builder will also need a menu bar for loading and saving item files.
